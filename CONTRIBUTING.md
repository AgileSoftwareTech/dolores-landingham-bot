## Contributing

### Code of conduct

We aspire to create a welcoming environment for collaboration on this project.
To that end, we follow the [18F Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
and ask that all contributors do the same.

### Not sure what to work on?

Issues that are ready for contributions are tagged with [help
wanted](https://github.com/18F/dolores-landingham-bot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

Comment on the issue you're working on so we all know who is working on what.

If you're thinking about working on a feature unrelated to an existing issue,
consider creating an issue before you start work to get feedback from the team.
We are always happy to receive pull requests but don't want anyone to feel like
they wasted time if a pull request is submitted but not merged.

### Git Protocol

To contribute to this project, people internal to 18F can create a branch and
submit a pull request. If you are external to 18F, you can fork the repository
and submit a pull request that way.

We are minimizing commits on the `master` branch by rebasing and squashing
commits on branches before merging them into `master`. This will require you to
force push on your branch (but not to `master`...please don't force push
`master`).

For a more detailed walk through on how to do this, you can read thoughtbot's
[Git
Protocol](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol/git#write-a-feature)
document.

18F-ers can merge their changes into master after getting approval from another
contributor. PRs can be merged manually by merging the branch into `master`
locally and pushing `master` or by using the merge button on GitHub.

### Managing time / Updating holidays

Each message created will send a specified number of **business days** after an
employee joins 18F.  What constitutes a business day is managed by the gem
`business_time` and is configured [here](config/initializers/business_time.rb)
and [here](config/business_time.yml). To add days that dolores will skip, add
that date to the `holidays` field in [this yaml config
file](config/business_time.yml).

### App setup

Before running the setup script, ensure that 'foreman' is removed from the Gemfile.

Prior to running 'bin/setup', it may be necessary to launch the postgres server using

```
postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
```

You can also use the [Postgres OSX app](http://postgresapp.com/).

To get started, run `bin/setup`

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

```bash
foreman start
``

If you don't have `foreman`, see [Foreman's install instructions][foreman]. It
is [purposefully excluded from the project's `Gemfile`][exclude].

[foreman]: https://github.com/ddollar/foreman
[exclude]: https://github.com/ddollar/foreman/pull/437#issuecomment-41110407

The application will run locally at http://localhost:5000/.

If you have previously run a project on a different port, a `.foreman` file
may be generated at the root of your directory. If so, make sure that this
file is set to port `5000` or you will be unable to authenticate locally with MyUSA.

If your server isn't defaulting to Port 5000, you may have to add a .foreman
file to root directory. In the file, add "port: 5000".

### Testing

Testing is done using `capybara-poltergeist`, which requires a local install of
[phantomjs](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist#installing-phantomjs).
You can run the entire test suite using:

```bash
rake
```

### Required Keys

The setup script creates a `.env` file with a dummy environment configuration
variables.  If you are internal to 18F and would like access to these configs,
you can contact Jessie Young. Otherwise, you can create a Slack bot
[here](https://18f.slack.com/services/new/bot).

### Authentication

We are using [OmniAuth GitHub Team
Auth](https://github.com/jonmagic/omniauth-github-team-member) for
authentication.

1. Create a [GitHub OAuth application](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/)
for development with the following:

  For Homepage url:

  `http://localhost:5000/`

  Authorization callback URL:

  `http://localhost:5000/auth/githubteammember/callback`

1. Save the client id and client secret from your new application in the `.env`
file in the app directory as `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` (see
.sample.env for formatting help)

1. Edit the `GITHUB_TEAM_ID` in your local `.env` file to match the id of a
GitHub team that you belong to.

The easiest way to find a Team ID on GitHub is to generate an [access
token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/)
and then curl with it:

```bash
curl https://api.github.com/user/teams?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

If you do not belong to a GitHub team or would like to set up the app without
doing the above, an alternative is to comment out the line in the controller
that confirms you are a member of the correct team:

```ruby
  # app/controllers/auth_controller

  ## put stuff here
```

## Granting Yourself Admin Access

Once you've logged in locally, open the Rails console and change
your admin status to "true".

```bash
rails c
user = User.last
user.update(admin: true)
```

This will allow you to create and schedule messages.

Note: scheduled messages may not send if you're using over the weekend, which is
due to the business_time gem referenced above.

## Deployment

Dolores is configured to be deployed with Cloud Foundry as an 18f-er.

Refer to [docs.18f.gov](https://docs.18f.gov/getting-started/setup/) for getting
set up with Cloud Foundry.

The Dolores Landingham bot is deployed within the `18f` Cloud Foundry org. To
see if you have access to the `18f` do the following in the root of your repo:

`cf orgs`

If `18f` does not show up as an available org, you can request access by
posting an issue to the [DevOps repo](https://github.com/18F/DevOps/issues/new)
on GitHub.

Once you have access to the org, you can target the Cloud Foundry organization
and space for this project:

`cf target -o 18f -s dolores`

Once your target is set, you can push the application. We have two Cloud Foundry
instances: `dolores-app` and `dolores-staging`. Test your changes by pushing to
`dolores-staging` before pushing to the `dolores-app` instance.

`cf push <app-instance-name>`

New migrations will be run automatically. See the [manifest](manifest.yml) for
more details on the Cloud Foundry setup.

To see existing environment variables:

`cf env <app-instance-name>`

To set or change the value of an environment variable:

`cf set-env <app-instance-name> <env-name> <env-value>`
